Made a small little project with Pygame where you can listen to and test your morse code abilities!

This application uses Python 2.9, and I haven't tested it on anything other than Windows. It's a small and compact bit of code that I had fun messing around with for a few days!

This application also uses Pygame, and the modules in it, to actually play the sounds of the morse. To use this, you'll need pygame.

Honestly, I had loads of fun making this small thing. Hope you enjoy it!
